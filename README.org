* About

This is a small PHP Framework, it makes some kind of MVC structure.

* Why?

I looked for a job, and I got the jobtest to write a small blog in PHP, with a Object Oriented MVC structure. I was allowed to use external PHP libs, but no big frameworks. So I wrote the base of this framework in two days, and then the blog and sent it as jobtest.

After that I feelt that I liked the framework and started my own project in it, and have fixed a bunch of bugs since I sent it to the company.

And I will probably continue to maintain this for my future projects.

* Todo

I want a ORM, that would be cool.
